Originally, I planed to build this website as a portfolio page to showcase my projects in classes. But I release journalling my life is a good way to, I'm the first person in my family that study abroad. So this is like a document of my self that save all of my memory so I can look it up when I get older. The content in this blog is including everything that happend in my lifes. It could be a journalling, like no emotion at all. Or a little bias in something. BTW, this blog is inspired by Huyen Chip, My Vu!!
