## Recommended Approach

For most users, I recommend **Approach 2** as it provides a good balance between ease of use and flexibility. You can keep your timeline data in the `data/timeline.yml` file and simply include the shortcode in your Markdown content.

If you need to create multiple different timelines or want to define the timeline content directly in your Markdown file, then **Approach 3** would be better.

## Don't Forget the CSS

Make sure the CSS is properly included in your site by adding it to your site's assets and importing it in your head partial as shown in the previous response.
