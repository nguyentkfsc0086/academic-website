Originally, I planed to build this website as a portfolio page to showcase my projects in classes. But I relize journalling my life is a good way, this is the unique time that I ever had in my life. So this is like a document of my self that save all of my memories so I can look it up when I get older. The content in the blogs is including everything that happening in my lifes. I will try to post at least 1 blog per week. Stay tune!!!!!!!!
