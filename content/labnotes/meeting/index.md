## 6/6/2025 Meeting
**Sumarize**\
The overall outcome of the project is:
- Buil an expanded verison of PrediXcan, concentrate it into brain dieses. Aim to provide more detailed insights

What I need to do next: 
- Build a model from the variant in chrosomes (X) and 103 brain tissues (Y) - Jingfeng took care of it. Apply it to people that we only have their genome type - to have a prediction in gene expression.
- Combine the result with additional information as the data for PrediXcan method to map with the trait association.

What I need to do in next week:
- Schedule an appointment with Jeingfeng so he can instruct me how to work download the data as well as get use to the enviroment.
