## About Me

I’m studying the University of Massachusetts Lowell, majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. I’m passionate about applying computer science to the fields of Biology and Healthcare. Currently, I’m working on an independent research project under the guidance of Professor Rachel Melamed in the Biology Department at the Kennedy College of Sciences.
