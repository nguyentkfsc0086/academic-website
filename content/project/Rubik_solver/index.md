This project was built at the time I taking my DSA class in college. This project aimed to solve a 2x2x2 rubik cube from a scramble state. At the end of the project, it only able to solve a rubik cube only from to steps of scramble. But it is a meaningfull thing to me because this is the first thing I ever built from scratch.
