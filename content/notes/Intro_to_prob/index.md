My learning note of the course Introduction to Probability by MIT
## Lecture 1
There is only a few axiom (rules) in this subject but very powerful \
**Sample space** \
There is 2 steps:
- Describe the posble outcomes by determine a list (set) of prosible outcomes
- Describe the beliefs of each outcome

The list (set) must be:
- Mutadly exclusive: There is only 1 possible outcome in from the list
- Collectively exhausive: There is more than one possible out come
- At the right granularity: It shoule make sense

*Example: head or tail of flipping coin*\
	There is a set with 2 possible outcome (head or tail) 
### Sample space: discrete/finite example:
- 2 rolls of the tetrahedridal dice\
We can represent it by 2 ways\
By this table\
*insert image* \
Or this graph ( sequencial description)\
*Insert image* \
Both of these are discrete space \
Finite: A unit square\
There is infinite points in a square => the probability of 2 point hit the same space is almost 0\
But if we have a set A in that square, the probability of a point in get hit in A is a specific number equal to the area of the set A\
